    "## Reading and Writing Files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common tasks that you can do with Python is reading and writing files. Whether it’s writing to a simple text file, reading a complicated server log, or even analyzing raw byte data, all of these situations require reading or writing a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this notebook, you’ll learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The basics of reading and writing files in Python\n",
    "- Some basic scenarios of reading and writing files\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Files are named locations on disk to store related information. They are used to permanently store data in a non-volatile memory (e.g. hard disk).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Random Access Memory (RAM) is volatile (which loses its data when the computer is turned off), we use files for future use of the data by permanently storing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to read from or write to a file, we need to open it first. When we are done, it needs to be closed so that the resources that are tied with the file are freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, in Python, a file operation takes place in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a file\n",
    "2. Read or write (perform operation)\n",
    "3. Close the file\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File Types\n",
    "\n",
    "What you may know as a file is slightly different in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows, for example, a file can be any item manipulated, edited or created by the user/OS. That means files can be images, text documents, executables, and much more. Most files are organized by keeping them in individual folders. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "In Python, a file is categorized as either **text** or **binary**, and the difference between the two file types is important. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Text files** are structured as a sequence of lines, where each line includes a sequence of characters. This is what you know as code or syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each line is terminated with a special character, called the EOL or End of Line character. There are several types, but the most common is the comma {,} or newline character. It ends the current line and tells the interpreter a new one has begun. \n",
    "\n",
    "A backslash character can also be used, and it tells the interpreter that the next character – following the slash – should be treated as a new line. This character is useful when you don’t want to start a new line in the text itself but in the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **binary file** is any type of file that is not a text file. Because of their nature, binary files can only be processed by an application that know or understand the file’s structure. In other words, they must be applications that can read and interpret binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading/Writing a File in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re working with Python, you don’t need to import a library in order to read and write files. It’s handled natively in the language, albeit in a unique manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you’ll need to do is use Python’s built-in **open** function to get a **file object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **open** function opens a file. It’s simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use the **open** function, it returns something called a **file object**. **File objects** contain methods and attributes that can be used to collect information about the file you opened. They can also be used to manipulate said file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the **mode** attribute of a **file object** tells you which mode a file was opened in. And the **name** attribute tells you the name of the file that the **file object** has opened.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "#### Open ( ) Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to open a file for writing or use in Python, you must rely on the built-in **open ()** function. \n",
    "\n",
    "As explained above, **open ()** will return a file object, so it is most commonly used with two arguments.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax to open a file object in Python is: \n",
    "\n",
    "`file_object  = open(“filename”, “mode”)` where file_object is the variable to add the file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second argument you see – **mode** – tells the interpreter and developer which way the file will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Mode|Description|\n",
    "|-----|----|\n",
    "|r|Opens a file for reading. (default)|\n",
    "|rb|Opens the file to read only in binary format. The file pointer exists at the beginning|\n",
    "|r+|It opens the file to read and write both. The file pointer exists at the beginning.|\n",
    "|rb+|It opens the file to read and write both in binary format. The file pointer exists at the beginning of the file.|\n",
    "|w|Opens a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exists.|\n",
    "|wb|It opens the file to write only in binary format. It overwrites the file if it exists previously or creates a new one if no file exists.|\n",
    "|w+|It opens the file to write and read data. It will override existing data.|\n",
    "|wb+|It opens the file to write and read both in binary format|\n",
    "|x|\tOpens a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails.|\n",
    "|a|\tOpens a file for appending at the end of the file without truncating it. Creates a new file if it does not exist.|\n",
    "|t|Opens in text mode. (default)|\n",
    "|b|Opens in binary mode.|\n",
    "|+|Opens a file for updating (reading and writing)|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let’s take a look at a quick example. \n",
    "\n",
    "$f = open(“workfile”,”w”)$ \n",
    "$print (f)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This snippet opens the file named “workfile” in writing mode so that we can make changes to it. The current information stored within the file is also displayed – or printed – for us to view. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once this has been done, you can move on to call the objects functions. The two most common functions are read and write.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider an example create a txt file. "
